#                                         ---------------------------GAME INFORMATION---------------------------

Console Runner is a very simple runner game where the player collects certain controller parts while moving forward, as the player collects the parts they will decorate the controller and form a fully finished controller once all pieces are connected. Once the player reaches the end, they will play a simple Space Shooter game to end the level.
The controls are made both for PC and mobile, an invisible analog stick will show up where the player touches/clicks and by moving the mouse or their finger the player can√º
move the controller in the desired direction.
